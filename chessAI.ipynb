    "How do we create an AI? The very first thing we need to think about is what we want to achieve and then we can go on and think how we can do so. Intuitively we want to win the game, but how can we express that? Well, we know for sure that some pieces are more powerful than others, that checkmating the king is what makes you win the game, but how do you express strategy?, what if sacrificing a piece can actually make us win the game? Well, this is very complicated...\n",
    "\n",
    "But for a moment let's suppose we can give to every player a score that sums up the number of pieces in the board and the position in the board (for instance, having a rook blocked is worse than having it attacking a piece, and having a pawn is better than not having one).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now simplify what means to win by saying that what we want to achieve is to have, in the near future, a better score than the one of our opponent. Note that by not forcing it to maximise the score at each move, we are allowing sacrifices to be made and leaving room for strategy. \n",

    "\n",
    "This intuitive idea is encoded by the Minimax algorithm. Each board state is represented by a node with the color of who's turn it is to move. Then from each move, we build out a tree of all the possible moves that can be done from that move on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since both players get a score, let's supose that the white player has a positive (+) score and the black player has a negative score (-) so we can easily compare who has an advantage in the game. If at a state we have a negative value, it means black has an edge, while if the value is positive, white has an edge.\n",

Chess is much more complicated, it is approximated that the average *branching factor*, that is the average number of possible moves at each state is somewhere about $b=35$. This example shows only tree of depth $d=3$ meaning that the algorithm is looking only at the possible outcomes in the next three moves.\n",
    "\n",

    "What happens with the current algorithm is that we might visit the same state multiple times. For example we can perform a couple of moves where the final state is the same, we must compute the score for the same state, multiple times. An idea could be to save the score for the state and then when we encounter that state again, we just used the value computed before. The question that naturally arises is: how can we save such values? To do so, we must implement a process to for creating a unique identifier out of the board so we can then retrieve the value when encountered again. But we need to do so efficiently, meaning that this process should be fast enough to justify the fact that to load the value is better than to recompute it again.\n",

    "The solution to this problem is to use a transposition table, a special kind of hash table that is indexed by board position. To generate an index out of the board position we use Zobrist hashing, a hash function invented by Albert Lindsey Zobrist which uses randmly generated bitstrings for every possible combination of a piece and position. Meaning that each of the 64 squares of the board will have associated 13 bitstrings, 12 for each the pieces and one associated to the fact of being empty. \n",

    "- we can use searches at smaller depth to improve alpha-beta heuristics (alpha–beta pruning is most efficient if it searches the best moves first).\n",
    "- we can return the best move at any time. By repeating the process, each time with one level in depth more, we are able to return the current best move at any time. This is particularly useful if we have time constraints. For example, we can descend the tree for 30 seconds, then we will return the answer, in the openings probably there are fewer moves than in the endgame, thus in the openings we might be able to descend deeper into the tree."

With the only differences being the fact that Deep Blue used 512 VLSI chips in parallel to execute the alpha-beta search algorithm thus mitigating the problems concerning the computational tractability, it used a kind of book for openings and endings and used uneven tree development exploring some branches deeper (for instance when a piece was captured or when there was a check).
